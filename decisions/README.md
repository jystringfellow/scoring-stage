# Decisions

One file per decision that constrains future work, named `YYYY-MM-DD-what-was-decided.md`. What stage owns today is
in the ownership table in [docs/design.md](../docs/design.md); live evidence is in
[VERIFICATION.md](../VERIFICATION.md).

- **When to add one:** only for a choice no test can fail on: something we chose not to build, an approach that
  was tried and rejected, or a rule about the work itself. Behaviour is held by its tests, and the reason for it by
  the commit that added them; do not repeat either here.
- **What it holds:** the decision as a title, why, what was rejected, and the evidence.
- **Replacing one:** only with new evidence. Add the new file and delete the one it replaces in the same change; say
  in the new file what changed.
- **This file is not an index.** Do not list decisions here; list the directory.
